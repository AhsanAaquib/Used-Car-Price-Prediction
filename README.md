__Project Title:__ Used Car Price Prediction

__Description:__ Developed a predictive model to estimate the prices of used cars based on various features such as vehicle age, mileage, fuel type,transmission and many more. Leveraged support vector regression (SVR) to handle the non-linear relationships between car attributes and their market price effectively. The SVR model was chosen for its robustness in managing high-dimensional data and minimizing prediction error.

__Key Highlights:__

- Implemented thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature engineering, EDA, Hypothesis Testing.
- Conducted data normalization and scaling to prepare for model building  ensuring better convergence and prediction performance.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE to validate predictive accuracy. SVR has the least RMSE value among others Algorithms.
- Delivered final price predictions and demonstrated model deployment readiness for real-world applications.
- This project showcased advanced data handling, modeling techniques, and effective use of machine learning algorithms to solve regression problems.
